#I created this repo to hold the dotfiles that contain my preferred setting
#for some of the tools that I use on my 'nix computers.
#please not that there are both  bashrc and bash_profile files.

#The bashrc file is for the bash shell on linux machines, and the
#bash_profile file is for the bash shell on my osx based macbook.

#You will need to rename them to add the dot back. For example, if you 
#pull the vimrc file into your own home directory, you will need to change
#the filename from vimrc to .vimrc (mv vimrc .vimrc)

#I followed this tutorial when I set this whole thing up:
#	https://github.com/dchardin/dotfiles	
#I will save a copy of the page in html format in this repo (just in case)
